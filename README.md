# CS-162

This repository contains all code from CS 162 - Introduction to Computer Science II.

This class had 2 types of assignments. Labs were shorter weekly exercies, and projects were larger bi-weekly assignments. 

For this class, I created utility functions that performed tasks such as validating user input to only accept a certain type, or if overloaded, only accept values in a certain range.
